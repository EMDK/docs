# KeyStroke - Profile Settings Reference

## Overview
In order to get Barcode or MSR data in your application, you must create a profile that has both an Input feature and an Output feature:

* [Barcode](../guide/profiles/profilebarcode) / [MSR](../guide/profiles/profilemsr) (Input)
* Intent or [Keystroke](../guide/profiles/profilekeystroke) (Output)

The `Barcode` feature in the Profile Manager is responsible for reading data from the device's integrated bar code scanner and supports different types of bar code readers including laser, imager and internal camera. It also contains detailed settings for scanner behavior as well as individual barcode symbology settings.

The `Intent` or `Keystroke` feature in the Profile Manager is used to define how the output from the Barcode scanner should be handled

* Intent - The Intent feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application using the Android Intent mechanism. To use this, you should be familiar with how to register to receive intents in your application as well as handling the data that is passed in. You will have the ability to configure how the intent is sent to your application in the profile itself.

* Keystroke - The Keystroke feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application by emulating keystrokes. You will have the option to control how the data is sent as well as if it should have any prefix or suffix automatically added using basic data formatting.

## Keystroke Output
