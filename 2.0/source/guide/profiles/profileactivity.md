# Activity Selection - Profile Reference

## Overview

When creating a profile for [Barcode](../guide/profiles/profilebarcode) or [MSR](../guide/profiles/profilemsr) data capture you can configure an Activity Selector to automate the process of activating and deactivating the profile. This allows for automated profile management of complex applications. 

##Activity Selector

* Applications - List of applications this profile may be active during. 
	* Applications names are the formal package definition of the application. For example "com.symbol.profiledatacapturesample1". 
* Activities -  List of activities within the selected application that a profile should be active for. 
	*  For Example "MainActivity".
