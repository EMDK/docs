# Wi-Fi Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview

The Wi-Fi feature allows you to manage your devices Wi-Fi settings as well as manage the network profiles to be used for connecting and remembering networks.

>Note: In order for settings to be applied, Wi-Fi must be enabled. If you do not specify WiFi Enable in the profile you will get an error when attempting to apply other settings if the device's Wi-Fi is not already enabled.

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.

## Country Selection Auto/Manual
By leaving this option unchecked, the country may be determined by the router or access point setting. To manually select the country, you should select the checkbox. When doing this a country drop-down will appear.

## Country
Country to use for Wi-Fi regulatory setting. 802.11d will not be enabled if you select 'U.S.A' in the Country drop-down. When you choose 'AUTO' in the drop-down, 802.11d will be enabled.

* Never Sleep - Leave Wi-Fi radio powered.

## Network Notification
Specifies whether or not to notify the user when a open network comes in range.

* Do not change - will use whatever the device is currently configured as.

* Remove an Existing Network - will remove the a network profile based on the SSID.
* Connect to an Existing Network - will initiate a connection to the network based on the SSID.
* Disconnect from an Existing Network - will disconnect from a network based on the SSID.

* Disable an Existing Network - will disable a network profile based on the SSID.
* Disable All Existing Networks - will disable all network profiles.
* Remove All Existing Networks - will remove all network profiles.

## Wi-Fi Profiles
Parameters used for adding a network. SSID is used to identify the network profile to be acted on when choosing an '... an Existing Network' network action above.

* SSID - the SSID name of the network
* Security Mode 
    * Open - Open network
    * Personal - PSK or WEP
    * Enterprise - 802.1x EAP profiles
* WPA Mode:  WPA mode used by the network. Ex: WPA, WPA2, WPA/WPA2, WEP
>Note: WEP is not supported with a Enterprise Security Mode. It is only supported using Personal Security Mode.

* Authentication Mode: Authentication mode used by the network. used with Enterprise Security Mode. Ex: EAP-TLS, EAP-FAST-GTC, EAP-FAST-MSCHAPV2, EAP-TTLS-PAP, EAP-TTLS-MSCHAP, EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPV2, LEAP, PEAP-MSCHAPV2, PEAP-GTC
* DHCP: When selected DHCP will be used. When not selected, Static IP address is used and IP address settings should be provided ex: Static IP Address, Gateway IP Address, Subnet Mask, DNS Server IP Address
* Proxy: When selected, a Proxy is used for network connections. Proxy settings should be supplied. Ex: Proxy Host Name, Port, Bypass Proxy

## Encryption Details
* Encryption Type: Type of encryption used by the network. The values in this drop-down will change based on the WPA Mode selected. Ex: TKIP, AES-CCMP, AES-CCMP/TKIP, WEP-40, WEP-104
* Key Type: Passphrase or Hex Key
* Protect Key: Enables encryption of the Key
* Web Key Index: Only `wep[0]` is a valid option

## Authentication Details
Specific authentication settings when Enterprise Mode and specific Authentication modes are selected.

* Identity - the name that should be used to join the network.
* Server Certificate - the name of the certificate alias that should be used to verify the server (Optional).
* Client Certificate - the name of the certificate alias that should be used to join the network (Mandatory).
* Anonymous Identity - the anonymous identity to be used to join the network.
* Password - the password to be used to connect to the network.
* Protect Password - when selected will encrypt the password.

### EAP-TLS and Certificate Alias 
Due to current limitations of the Certificate Manager Feature (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to "override" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore

The only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android KeyStore after installation to determine which Alias was used:

1. The same Alias will ALWAYS be assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed

2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias will generally be assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key

#### Manually Determining the Certificate Alias
A device can be used to capture the alias being used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that the key store be cleared before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials)

1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.
2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network
3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP
4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS
5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop down box with "(unspecified)" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.

## Advanced Options

>Note: The following steps must be followed in order to use the Advanced Options under the WiFi feature:
>
>* PMKID must be enabled in order to enable PreAuth (PreAuth =1 and PMKID =1)
>* FT must be enabled in order to enable FTRIC (FT=1 and FTRIC =1)
>* OKC must be disabled (OKC =0 and PMKID =1) in order to use PMKID caching
>
> Important Note: The default "Fast Power Savings" value must be used for the "Power Save" parameter under the Advanced Options. Using the "Do Not Change" value will result in failure.
