# Analytics Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview

The Analytics Manager profile feature allows you to configure what data about a device should be collected, and where the collected data should be stored.

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.

## Main Functionality

##Group Action
Choosing to configure levels for multiple Groups will allow you choose a collection level for each data group. For instance, you can set the CPU Usages data group to "High" 

Choosing to configure details for a single group will allow you choose an interval and which metrics should be collected for a group. For instance, you can set the system information group to collect every 5 minutes, and to include the memory load.
