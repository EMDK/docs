# Cellular Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview

The Cellular Manager feature allows you to configure options of the  cellular radio on your device. 

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.
