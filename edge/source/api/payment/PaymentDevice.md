#PaymentDevice

PaymentDevice class will represent and provides access to the physical
 payment device.
 
 

##Public Methods

### isEnabled

**public boolean isEnabled()**

Checks if the connection with the payment device is enabled or not.

**Returns:**

boolean - true : if the connection with the payment device is enabled 
 		   false : if the connection with payment device is not enabled

### getDeviceInfo

**public DeviceInfo getDeviceInfo()**

Returns information about the payment device.

**Returns:**

com.symbol.emdk.payment.DeviceInfo - Returns the DeviceInfo object.

### enable

**public void enable()**

This is an asynchronous call and status of the enable method will be returned through the registered  PaymentDevice.DataListener.
 This method is used to establish communication with the payment device and enable the payment device to do transactions.
 This method does not do any transactions.
 
 The following requirements must satisfy before calling enable method:
  - The payment device must paired with the mobile device.
  - The paired payment device name or MAC address must be set using  PaymentDevice.setInterfaceConfig(InterfaceConfig interfaceConfig).
  - The clients must implement  PaymentDevice.DataListener and call  PaymentDevice.addDataListener(DataListener listener) 
  
  Only one session can be enabled at any given time.
  The Bluetooth connection will fail if the payment device is not already paired. 
  The application can call other methods only after successful enabling. 
  If the same of payment device is used by other application, enable will fail and returns error.
  If payment device shows Bluetooth connection status screen ,calling enable method will return communication error.
  You must call disable() when you are done the payment transactions,
  otherwise it will remain locked and be unavailable to other applications.
  enable() returns "device is not paired" status ,when the BT is turned off or does not have any payment devices paired.

Completes an online EMV transaction for PIN management. The application
 must call authorizeCard before calling this API else API returns API_SEQUENCE_ERROR.
 This is an asynchronous call. After the processing, the response (i.e.,EmvData object) 
 is returned through the registered DataListener.

**Parameters:**

`hostDecision` - HostDecision enum value which is the decision indicator from
            the host response.

`displayResult` - Indicator to note whether or not to display the final response
            message. The valid values are: false - Do not display, true -
            Display

`tagData` - List of EMV data which contains EMV tag and its values.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	ArrayList<TagData> emvDataList = new ArrayList<TagData>();
	emvDataList.add(new TagData("5A085413330089601075"));

 if the tag is not listed in the getEMVTags table.For more information on 
 the table refer PaymentAPI_ProgrammersGuide. After the processing,
 the response (TagData contains TLV raw data as per EMV specification) 
 and also its parsed tag,length and value format is returned through  
 the registered DataListener. If we pass null as a parameter the API
 returns all the tag data listed in table in TLV format.
 The application must call  readCardData before calling the getEmvTags.

**Parameters:**
