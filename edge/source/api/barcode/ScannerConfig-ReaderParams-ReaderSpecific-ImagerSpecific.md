#ScannerConfig.ReaderParams.ReaderSpecific.ImagerSpecific

ImagerSpecific provides access to the imager specific parameters.

##Public Fields

###continuousRead

ContinuousRead class provides access to continuous scanning related parameters.

**Type:**

com.symbol.emdk.barcode.ScannerConfig.ReaderParams.ReaderSpecific.ContinuousRead

###beamTimer

Sets the maximum amount of time that the reader remains on (0 - 60,000 ms in increments of 100 ms). 
 A value of 0 sets the reader to stay on indefinitely.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	readerParams.beamTimer = 1500;


**Type:**

int

###linearSecurityLevel

Sets the number of times a bar code is read to confirm an accurate decode.
 Use enum  ScannerConfig.LinearSecurityLevel.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	readerParams.linearSecurityLevel = LinearSecurityLevel.ALL_THRICE;


**Type:**

com.symbol.emdk.barcode.ScannerConfig.LinearSecurityLevel

###pickList

Allows the imager to decode only the bar code that is directly under the cross-hair/reticle (+) part of the pattern. 
 This feature is useful in applications where multiple bar codes may appear in the field of view during a decode session and 
 only one of them is targeted for decode.
 Use enum  ScannerConfig.PickList.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	imagerSpecific.picklist = PickList.DISABLED;


**Type:**

com.symbol.emdk.barcode.ScannerConfig.PickList

###lcdMode

Enables or disables LCD mode. 
 LCD mode enhances the ability of the imager to read bar codes from LCD displays such as cellphones (imager only).
 Use enum  ScannerConfig.LcdMode.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	imagerSpecific.lcdMode = LcdMode.DISABLED;


**Type:**

com.symbol.emdk.barcode.ScannerConfig.LcdMode

###inverse1DMode

This parameter allows the user to select decoding on inverse 1D bar codes.
 Use enum  ScannerConfig.Inverse1DMode.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	imagerSpecific.inverse1DMode = Inverse1DMode.AUTO;


**Type:**

com.symbol.emdk.barcode.ScannerConfig.Inverse1DMode

###illuminationBrightness

Illumination Brightness of the Imager. The valid range is 1 to 10.
 
 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	imagerSpecific.illuminationBrightness = 2;


**Type:**

int

###disconnectOnExit

This parameter indicates to the scan driver to disconnect any existing connection between an 
 external Bluetooth scanner and the terminal. When a BT scanner establishes connection to the terminal 
 it will not automatically disconnect when the scanner is disabled by calling Scanner.disable(). 
 If this parameter is set the scanning driver will force the scanner to disconnect.
 
 Note: If this parameter is set to true, it will not fire the DISCONNECTED state.

**Type:**

boolean

###connectionIdleTime

This is the time (in seconds) when an external scanner is idle in a particular state (ScannerStates.IDLE to 
 ScannerStates.WAITING) after which the connection between the terminal and the scanner is severed to conserve
 power. This is currently applicable to Bluetooth scanners only.

**Type:**

int
