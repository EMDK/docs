#MifareDesfire

Provides access to MIFARE DESFire properties and I/O operations on an IsoDep
 Tag object. This class encapsulates all the methods required for
 communicating with the IsoDep tag using the tag technology protocol.


 

**Example Usage:**
	
	:::java	
	public class MainActivity  extends Activity implements EMDKListener {
	SecureNfcManager secureNfcManager;
	EMDKManager emdkManager;
	SamType samType;
	MifareDesfire mifaredesfire;
	MifareSam mifareSam;
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	EMDKResults results = EMDKManager.getEMDKManager(getApplicationContext(), this);
	}
	public void onOpened(EMDKManager emdkManager) {
	this.emdkManager = emdkManager;
	this.secureNfcManager = (secureNfcManager)
	this.emdkManager.getInstance(FEATURE_TYPE.SECURENFC);
	if(this.secureNfcManager != null){
	try{

	}


##Public Methods

### enable

**public void enable(Tag tag)**

Enable I/O operations to tfhe tag from IsoDep object and SAM
 communication. May cause RF activity and may block. Must not be called
 from the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
 MiFareDesfireExpection by calling close() from another thread. Only one
 TagTechnology object can be connected to a Tag at a time. Applications
 must call close() when I/O operations are complete.On Tag lost connection
 needs to re-established by calling enable API in the application.

**Parameters:**

tag - Contactless tag already detected by device. We get this
            through the EXTRA_TAG information from the intent.

**Returns:**

void

**Throws:**

com.symbol.emdk.securenfc.MifareDesfireExpection

The exception will be thrown if it fails to enable the tag.

### disable

**public void disable()**

Disables I/O operations to the tag from IsoDep object and SAM
 communication. Also causes all blocked I/O operations on other thread to
 be canceled and return with MiFareDesfireExpection.On Tag lost connection
 needs to re-established by calling enable API in the application.This is
 a synchronous call.

**Returns:**

void

**Throws:**

com.symbol.emdk.securenfc.MifareDesfireExpection

The exception will be thrown if it fails to disable the tag.

### authenticate

**public void authenticate(MifareDesfire.AuthenticateType authType, int cardKeyNum, SamKey samkey, SamDiverseParams samDiverseParams)**

Authenticates card master key and application key by using SAM This is an
 I/O operation and will block until complete. It must not be called from
 the main application thread. A blocked call will be canceled with
 IOException if close() is called from another thread.On Tag lost
 connection needs to re-established by calling enable API in the
 application.

 NOTE : This API must not be called from the main application thread since
 it is time consuming operation.

**Parameters:**

authType - Type of authentication to be used.
