# SDCard Manager Profile Feature Reference


## Overview

The SdCard Manager allows your application to manage the use of the devices SD card.

This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.
