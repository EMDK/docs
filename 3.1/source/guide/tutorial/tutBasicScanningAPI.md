# Basic Scanning Tutorial using Barcode API

## Overview

This guide will walk you through creating an EMDK For Android application that will use [Barcode/Scanning APIs](../guide/reference/EMDKList) introduced in EMDK V 3.0, to perform Scanning operations on your Symbol Android devices without using Profile Wizard. The API uses [Barcode Manager](../api/BarcodeManager), which is the primary object to access barcode scanning feature. 

In this tutorial, we will explore the [Barcode/Scanning API](../guide/reference/EMDKList) by using it for developing a basic application that will scan barcodes.

> Note: You don't need the Profile Wizard while using the Barcode/Scanning APIs as everything could be configured programmatically through code.   
        
###Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Android Developer Tools (ADT) ([Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)/[Eclipse with ADT](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html))
* EMDK for Android V 3.0 and above 

For more information about setting up the EMDK please see the EMDK Overview.

## Creating The Project

> Note: Provide "BasicScanningTutorial" as the project name for this tutorial.

If you are using Android Studio, click [here](../guide/tutorial/tutCreateProjectAndroidStudio).

If you are using Eclipse with ADT, click [here](../guide/tutorial/tutCreateProjectEclipseADT).  

## Enabling the EMDK
If you are using Android Studio, you have already completed this step while creating the project by selecting `EMDK 3.1 (API 16) (Symbol Technologies, Inc.) (API 16)` or `EMDK 3.1 (API 19) (Symbol Technologies, Inc.) (API 19)` as the minimum SDK.

If you are using Eclipse with ADT, click [here](../guide/tutorial/tutEnableEMDKEclipseADT) for Enabling the EMDK tutorial as it would again be a common step for all of your projects that are using EMDK for Android API.   

## Enabling Android Permissions
1. Modify the Application's Manifest.xml to use the EMDK library and to set permission for the EMDK to scan the barcodes.
  
    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/manifest_file.jpg)

    You must first enable permissions for 'com.symbol.emdk.permission.EMDK':  
   
        :::xml
        <uses-permission android:name="com.symbol.emdk.permission.EMDK" /> 

    Then you must enable the library for EMDK:  
      
        :::xml
        <uses-library android:name="com.symbol.emdk" />

    When done, your manifest.xml should look like:

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/manifest_permissions_added.jpg) 

##Adding Some Code    
1. Now we will start to add some code. 

    First you must add references to the libraries:  
    
        :::java
        import com.symbol.emdk.EMDKManager;
		import com.symbol.emdk.EMDKManager.EMDKListener;
		import com.symbol.emdk.barcode.ScanDataCollection;
		import com.symbol.emdk.barcode.Scanner.DataListener;
		import com.symbol.emdk.barcode.Scanner.StatusListener;
		import com.symbol.emdk.barcode.StatusData;   

    Then you must extend the activity to implement EMDKListener. Use Eclipse's Content Assist to implement the unimplemented functions of `onOpened` and `onClosed`.

    After that you also need to implement StatusListener for notifying client applications to notify scan events. Override its `onStatus` function.

    Finally implement DataListener for notifying client applications when the scan data is available. Override its `onData` function.

	> 
	> OR
	> 
	> If you are using Eclipse with ADT, press CTRL+SHFT+O or CMD+SHFT+O to organize imports.
    
        :::java
        public class MainActivity extends Activity implements EMDKListener, StatusListener, DataListener{  
          
            .. .. .. .. .. .. ...  
          
            @Override  
            public void onClosed() {  
                   // TODO Auto-generated method stub  
            }  
          
            @Override  
            public void onOpened(EMDKManager emdkManager) {  
                   // TODO Auto-generated method stub  
            }

            @Override
	        public void onData(ScanDataCollection scanDataCollection) {
		           // TODO Auto-generated method stub
	        }

	        @Override
	        public void onStatus(StatusData statusData) {
		           // TODO Auto-generated method stub
	        }  
          
        }      

    We will now create some global variables to hold the instance objects of EMDKManager, BarcodeManager and Scanner. These variables would be used throughout the code.

    We will then add some UI elements starting with a [TextView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html) to display the status of scanning operation and then [EditText](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) to populate scanned barcode data.
 
    
        :::java
        // Declare a variable to store EMDKManager object
		private EMDKManager emdkManager = null;
	
		// Declare a variable to store Barcode Manager object
		private BarcodeManager barcodeManager = null;
	
		// Declare a variable to hold scanner device to scan
		private Scanner scanner = null;
	
		// Text view to display status of EMDK and Barcode Scanning Operations
		private TextView statusTextView = null;
	
		// Edit Text that is used to display scanned barcode data
		private EditText dataView = null;

    The code till here looks like:
    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/variables_added.jpg) 

2. Now, let us design the simple UI that has a [TextView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html) to display the status of scanning operation and above that an [EditText](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) to populate scanned barcode data.

    So, remove all the code, inside "res/layout/activity_main.xml" and add following XML layout code for UI.

        :::xml
        <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:padding="16dip"
        tools:context=".MainActivity" >

          <EditText
          android:id="@+id/editText1"
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:layout_above="@+id/textViewStatusTitle"
          android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
          android:ems="10"
          android:fadeScrollbars="true"
          android:inputType="none|textMultiLine" />

          <TextView
          android:id="@+id/textViewStatus"
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:layout_centerInParent="true"
          android:text="" />

          <TextView
          android:id="@+id/textViewStatusTitle"
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:layout_above="@+id/textViewStatus"
          android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
          android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"
          android:text="Status:" />

        </RelativeLayout>

    > Note: Press CTRL+SHFT+F or CMD+SHFT+F for indentation.     
 
3. In the onCreate method, we take reference of UI elements that are declared in "res/layout/activity_main.xml" in order to use them in our [Activity](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html). We then call getEMDKManager so that the EMDK can be initialized and checked to see if it is ready. 

        :::java
        // Reference to UI elements
		statusTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textViewStatus);
		dataView = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText1);

		// The EMDKManager object will be created and returned in the callback.
		EMDKResults results = EMDKManager.getEMDKManager(
				getApplicationContext(), this);
		// Check the return status of getEMDKManager and update the status Text
		// View accordingly
		if (results.statusCode != EMDKResults.STATUS_CODE.SUCCESS) {
			statusTextView.setText("EMDKManager Request Failed");
		}

    So the complete `onCreate` method looks like:
     
     ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/on_create_added.jpg)

4. We will write a method `initializeScanner` to initialize and enable the scanner and its listeners by using [Barcode Manager](../api/BarcodeManager) object. The `enable` method enables the scanner hardware. This method does not make the scanner to scan or turn on the laser. Basically it will make the scanner device available for your application. If the same of scanner is enabled by other applications, this will throws ScannerExceptions. You must call `disable()` when you are done the scanning, otherwise it will remain locked and be unavailable to other applications.

	Once the barcode is enabled, we will call `read` method on scanner. The scanning API provides `read` method that starts an asynchronous Scan. The method will not turn ON the scanner. It will, however, put the scanner in a state in which the scanner can be turned ON either by pressing a hardware trigger or can be turned ON automatically. This is determined by the `Scanner.TriggerType`. The data notification must registered in order to scan and get the Scan Data. The read request can be canceled by issuing a `cancelRead`. If a `read()` is submitted while another read is pending, the method call will fail. It is recommended to check whether a read is pending by calling `isReadPending()` before submitting a `read()`. A read() can also be submitted from within `onData` and `onStatus` events. If called within `onStatus`, it should be called only when IDLE status is received. If called within `onData`, then checking for `isReadPending()` is recommended.

	> Note: The `read` method allows you to scan the barcode only once. If you want to scan the barcodes multiple times then call `read` multiple times. Hence later in this tutorial, we will also call `read` in the `onData` callback method, which is executed every time a barcode is scanned. 


        :::java
        // Method to initialize and enable Scanner and its listeners
		private void initializeScanner() throws ScannerException {
	
			if (scanner == null) {
	
				// Get the Barcode Manager object
				barcodeManager = (BarcodeManager) this.emdkManager
						.getInstance(FEATURE_TYPE.BARCODE);
	
				// Get default scanner defined on the device
				scanner = barcodeManager.getDevice(DeviceIdentifier.DEFAULT);
	
				// Add data and status listeners
				scanner.addDataListener(this);
				scanner.addStatusListener(this);
	
				// Hard trigger. When this mode is set, the user has to manually
				// press the trigger on the device after issuing the read call.
				scanner.triggerType = TriggerType.HARD;
	
				// Enable the scanner
				scanner.enable();
	
				// Starts an asynchronous Scan. The method will not turn ON the
				// scanner. It will, however, put the scanner in a state in which
				// the scanner can be turned ON either by pressing a hardware
				// trigger or can be turned ON automatically.
				scanner.read();
			}
		}

    The `initializeScanner` method looks like:
     
     ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/initialize_scanner_method.jpg)

5. Now we need to use the `onOpened` method to get a reference to the EMDKManager. The EMDKListener interface will trigger this event when the EMDK is ready to be used. The EMDKListener interface must be implemented in order to get a reference to the EMDKManager APIs. This event will pass the EMDKManager instance and we assign it to the global variable `emdkManager` that we created in the earlier steps. We have used that instance to get an instance [Barcode Manager](../api/BarcodeManager) to enable scanning.

    > Note: 
    > Rename the argument of `onOpened` method from `arg0` to `emdkManager`  

        :::java
        this.emdkManager = emdkManager;

		try {
			// Call this method to enable Scanner and its listeners
			initializeScanner();
		} catch (ScannerException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

		// Toast to indicate that the user can now start scanning
		Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,
				"Press Hard Scan Button to start scanning...",
				Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();  

    Your complete onOpened method should now look like this:
    
    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/on_opened_method.jpg)

6. As mentioned earlier that whenever a barcode is scanned, its data will be received in a callback `onData` method upon data availability. So we need to get that data, process it in the format we want and populate in the [EditText](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) of UI.

    The received data should be processed on a background thread not to block the UI thread. Hence we will use Android's own [AsyncTask](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html) to process the scanned data on background thread. So we create AsyncTask `AsyncDataUpdate` that takes [ScanDataCollection](../api/ScanDataCollection), which has the scanned data. It then processes this object in `doInBackground` method to filter the barcode data and label type in strings, which is then passed to the UI thread in `onPostExecute` method of AsyncTask to Populate.

	As mentioned earlier we would call `read` method here in this callback so that the user can scan multiple barcodes.

        :::java
        // Update the scan data on UI
		int dataLength = 0;
	
		// AsyncTask that configures the scanned data on background
		// thread and updated the result on UI thread with scanned data and type of
		// label
		private class AsyncDataUpdate extends
				AsyncTask<ScanDataCollection, Void, String> {
	
			@Override
			protected String doInBackground(ScanDataCollection... params) {
	
				// Status string that contains both barcode data and type of barcode
				// that is being scanned
				String statusStr = "";
	
				try {
	
					// Starts an asynchronous Scan. The method will not turn ON the
					// scanner. It will, however, put the scanner in a state in
					// which
					// the scanner can be turned ON either by pressing a hardware
					// trigger or can be turned ON automatically.
					scanner.read();
	
					ScanDataCollection scanDataCollection = params[0];
	
					// The ScanDataCollection object gives scanning result and the
					// collection of ScanData. So check the data and its status
					if (scanDataCollection != null
							&& scanDataCollection.getResult() == ScannerResults.SUCCESS) {
	
						ArrayList<ScanData> scanData = scanDataCollection
								.getScanData();
	
						// Iterate through scanned data and prepare the statusStr
						for (ScanData data : scanData) {
							// Get the scanned data
							String barcodeDate = data.getData();
							// Get the type of label being scanned
							LabelType labelType = data.getLabelType();
							// Concatenate barcode data and label type
							statusStr = barcodeDate + " " + labelType;
						}
					}
	
				} catch (ScannerException e) {
					// TODO Auto-generated catch block
					e.printStackTrace();
				}
	
				// Return result to populate on UI thread
				return statusStr;
			}
	
			@Override
			protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
				// Update the dataView EditText on UI thread with barcode data and
				// its label type
				if (dataLength++ > 50) {
					// Clear the cache after 50 scans
					dataView.getText().clear();
					dataLength = 0;
				}
				dataView.append(result + "\n");
			}
	
			@Override
			protected void onPreExecute() {
			}
	
			@Override
			protected void onProgressUpdate(Void... values) {
			}
		}

    We call this AsyncTask in overridden `onData` method, by creating an instance of `AsyncDataUpdate` and passing the `scanDataCollection` for further processing.

        :::java
        // Use the scanned data, process it on background thread using AsyncTask
		// and update the UI thread with the scanned results
		new AsyncDataUpdate().execute(scanDataCollection);

    So the `onData` method and `AsyncDataUpdate` looks like:

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/async_data_update.jpg)

	![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/async_data_update_remaining_1.jpg)

	and here is the remaining part of the `AsyncDataUpdate`.

	![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/async_data_update_remaining_2.jpg)

	> Note: The `AsyncDataUpdate` has been divided into multiple screen captures due to long body.
  
7. Whether we scan the barcode by pressing the hard scan key or keep it idle, it returns the status of the scanner at specific point of time in the overridden `onStatus` method of implemented `StatusListener` interface. Since we are also displaying the status along with barcode data, we will make use of this method and populate the status.

    Just like scanned data, we are also processing the scanner status on a background thread. Hence we will create another [AsyncTask](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html) named `AsyncStatusUpdate` that takes [StatusData](../api/StatusData) and processes it in `doInBackground` method to retrieve state in string format which is populated in status Text View on UI thread in `onPostExecute` method of the AsyncTask.              

        :::java
        // AsyncTask that configures the current state of scanner on background
		// thread and updates the result on UI thread
		private class AsyncStatusUpdate extends AsyncTask<StatusData, Void, String> {
	
			@Override
			protected String doInBackground(StatusData... params) {
				String statusStr = "";
				// Get the current state of scanner in background
				StatusData statusData = params[0];
				ScannerStates state = statusData.getState();
				// Different states of Scanner
				switch (state) {
				// Scanner is IDLE
				case IDLE:
					statusStr = "The scanner enabled and its idle";
					break;
				// Scanner is SCANNING
				case SCANNING:
					statusStr = "Scanning..";
					break;
				// Scanner is waiting for trigger press
				case WAITING:
					statusStr = "Waiting for trigger press..";
					break;
				// Scanner is not enabled
				case DISABLED:
					statusStr = "Scanner is not enabled";
					break;
				default:
					break;
				}
	
				// Return result to populate on UI thread
				return statusStr;
			}
	
			@Override
			protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
				// Update the status text view on UI thread with current scanner
				// state
				statusTextView.setText(result);
			}
	
			@Override
			protected void onPreExecute() {
			}
	
			@Override
			protected void onProgressUpdate(Void... values) {
			}
		}

    We call this AsyncTask in overridden `onStatus` method, by creating an instance of `AsyncStatusUpdate` and passing the `StatusData` for further processing.

        :::java
        // process the scan status event on the background thread using
		// AsyncTask and update the UI thread with current scanner state
		new AsyncStatusUpdate().execute(statusData);

    So the `onStatus` method and `AsyncStatusUpdate` looks like:

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/async_status_update.jpg)

	and here is the remaining part of the `AsyncStatusUpdate`.

	![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/async_status_update_remaining.jpg)

	> Note: The `AsyncStatusUpdate` has been divided into multiple screen captures due to long body.

8. Now let's override the `onDestroy` method so we can release the EMDKManager resources:  

        :::java
        @Override
	    protected void onDestroy() {
		 super.onDestroy();
		 if (emdkManager != null) {

			// Clean up the objects created by EMDK manager
			emdkManager.release();
			emdkManager = null;
		 }
	    } 

    Your `onDestroy` method should now look like this:  

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/on_destroy_method.jpg)

9. When we are done with scanning, we must release the scanner hardware resources for other applications to use. So override `onStop` method and disable the scanner to release it.

        :::java
        @Override
	    protected void onStop() {
		  // TODO Auto-generated method stub
		  super.onStop();
		  try {
			if (scanner != null) {
				// releases the scanner hardware resources for other application
				// to use. You must call this as soon as you're done with the
				// scanning.
				scanner.disable();
				scanner = null;
			}
		  } catch (ScannerException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		  }
	    }

    Your `onStop` method should now look like this:  

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/on_stop_method.jpg) 

10. Finally, Clean up the objects created by EMDK manager in `onClosed` method, if EMDK closed abruptly.

        :::java
        // The EMDK closed abruptly. // Clean up the objects created by EMDK
		// manager
		if (this.emdkManager != null) {

			this.emdkManager.release();
			this.emdkManager = null;
		}

    Your `onClosed` method should now look like this:  

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/on_closed_method.jpg)
	
That's it!!! We are done with all the coding part that will let us scan the barcodes of configured decoder params on Symbol Android device using [Barcode/Scanning APIs](../guide/reference/EMDKList) introduced in EMDK V 3.0. Now let us run the application.
 
## Running the Application

1. Connect the device (having latest EMDK runtime) to USB port. 

    > Note:   
    > Make sure the device is in USB debug.
 
2. Run the application.

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/home_screen.png)

    You can see a [Toast](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html), which indicates that the Scanner has been enabled and you can start scanning by pressing hard scan button of the device.
  
3. Now if you press the hard scan button, the status listener in the code starts working and current status of Scanner is displayed in Status [TextView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html), which is `Scanning`.  

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/status_scanning.png)

4. Once you are done with scanning and release the hard scan button, data gets populated on [EditText](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) and status is again updated in Status [TextView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html), which is `Idle`.

    ![img](images/BasicScanningTutorialImages/status_idle.png)  

    This is how [Barcode/Scanning APIs](../guide/reference/EMDKList) introduced in EMDK V 3.0 can be used to perform Basic Scanning operations on your Symbol devices without using Profile Wizard. We will see the [Barcode/Scanning APIs](../guide/reference/EMDKList) in depth to perform advanced scanning operations in the next tutorial. 

##Important Programming Tips##

1. It is required to do the following changes in the application's AndroidManifest.xml:  
  
    >Note:
    >* Include the permission for EMDK:  
    
        :::xml
        <uses-permission android:name="com.symbol.emdk.permission.EMDK"/>
    
	>Note:
    >* Use the EMDK library:  
    
        :::xml
        <uses-library android:name="com.symbol.emdk"/>
  
2. Installing the EMDK for Android application without deploying the EMDK runtime on the Symbol device will fail because of missing shared library on the device.
 
4. Use the DataWedge v1.7.12 or higher version to test the ProfileManager.processProfile() for DataWedge profiles.

## What's Next
Now that you have learned how to perform Basic Scanning operations on your Symbol Android devices through applications without using Profile Wizard, let us try to understand the API in depth and perform some advanced scanning. So in the next tutorial, we will concentrate on [Barcode/Scanning APIs](../guide/reference/EMDKList) in depth and use it to perform advanced scanning operations by creating a tutorial.
