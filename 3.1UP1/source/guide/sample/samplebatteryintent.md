# Battery Intent Sample

## Overview
On Symbol Android devices like the MC40, extra battery information can be retrieved using the standard [Android Battery Intent](http://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring.html). Setting up to receive this information is the same as with consumer Android devices. However, the data that is returned to your application includes some extra information like:

* Backup Battery Voltage
* Battery Manufacture Date
* Battery Serial Number
* Part Number for Battery
* Unique ID for Battery
* Rated Capacity of the Battery
* Charge Cycle count of the Battery
