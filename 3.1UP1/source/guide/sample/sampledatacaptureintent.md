# Data Capture Intent Sample

## Overview
This sample demonstrates how to use the DataWedge Intent output plug-in and the [Data Capture Intent API](../guide/reference/refdatacaptureintent) to receive captured data in your native Android application. 

A [Tutorial](../guide/tutorial/tutdatacaptureintent) walks through how this sample application was built from scratch. If you would simply like to see the application run on your device, follow the instructions in the next section.
