##Resolving JDK version conflict

This section will provide the required steps to modify the Info.plist of the Android Studio.app, in order to enable the support for plug-ins built using **JDK 7**.

Android Studio 1.1.0 is configured with **JDK 6**. Once the EMDK Wizard plug-in has been installed on Android Studio, if there is a JDK version conflict the following symptoms can be observed.

Notification stating an internal IDE error.

Empty EMDK Wizard menu

If these symptoms are observed check the JRE version used by the Android studio. Please refer the following steps:

1. Click on Android Studio > About Android Studio

	![img](images/setup/mac/image20.png)

2. Check the JRE version

	![img](images/setup/mac/image21.png)



If the JRE version is 1.6.x the EMDK Wizard plug-in for Android studio will fail. Hence, to solve this issue the info.plist of the Android Studio app will have to be configured. The configuration change will set the JRE version used by Android Studio as 1.7.x. Please refer the following steps:

1. Launch Finder > click on Applications on the left side pane > locate the Android Studio.app

	![img](images/setup/mac/image22.png)


2. Right click on the Android Studio.app > select Show Package Contents

	![img](images/setup/mac/image23.png)

3. Expand the Contents directory > create a backup copy of the Info.plist > open the Info.plist using a text editor

	![img](images/setup/mac/image24.png)

	![img](images/setup/mac/image25.png)


4. Search and locate the <key>JVMVersion</key> entry > change the 1.6* to 1.6+ > Save the file and exit the editor.

	![img](images/setup/mac/image26.png)


5. Exit and launch the Android Studio IDE and check the EMDK Wizard menu item, it should be visible now.

	![img](images/setup/mac/image27.png)

6. Additionally check the JRE version of the Android Studio; it should now be 1.7.x.

##Configuring ADB connectivity with Symbol Android devices on Mac OSX
The ADB connectivity on Mac OS X for Symbol Android devices will not be successful by default. Therefore the Symbol Vendor ID needs to be specified under third party USB Vendor ID list to get the device connected on Mac OS X.

>NOTE: The Google Mobile Service (GMS) devices (ex: TC 55 GMS) will be connected without any change to the USB Vendor ID list.

To add the Symbol Vendor ID to ADB:

1. Enter the following command using a terminal: `echo 0x05e0 >> ~/.android/adb_usb.ini`
2. Next, navigate to the ADB directory: `cd /Users/<user>/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/`
3. Stop the the adb service if it is running: `./adb kill-server`
3. Connect a Symbol Android device and enter the following command verify the list of attached devices:
	`./adb devices`
