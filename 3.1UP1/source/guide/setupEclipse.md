# EMDK For Android Setup (Eclipse)

## Install EMDK for Eclipse

### Installing Eclipse
1.	Go to [http://eclipse.org/downloads/](http://eclipse.org/downloads/).
2.	Download `Eclipse IDE for Java Developers` 3.7.2 (Indigo) or greater.
3.	Make a note of the name and location where you save the Eclipse on your system-you will need to refer to the standalone Eclipse directory later when installing EMDK for Android.

> NOTE: Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) is no longer supported with the latest version of ADT.

### Installing ADT Plugin to Eclipse
>NOTE: Since Google has released Android Studio, the ADT **Bundle** is no longer available for download. You will need to install Eclipse with the ADT **Plug-In** instead.

1.	Start Eclipse, then select `Help : Install New Software`.
2.	Click `Add`, in the top-right corner.
3.	In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter `ADT Plugin` for the Name and the following URL for the Location: `https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/`

	> NOTE: The Android Developer Tools update site requires a secure connection. Make sure the update site URL you enter starts with HTTPS.
4.	Click `OK`.
5.	In the Available Software dialog, select the check box next to Developer Tools and click Next.
6.	In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. `Click Next`.
7.	Read and accept the license agreements, then click `Finish`.

	> NOTE: If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK.
8.	When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.

>NOTE: EMDK for Android requires ADT v22.3.0-887826 or higher version.

### Installing Android SDK
1.	Go to [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
2.	Click on the hyperlink [Other Download Options](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) or scroll down towards the section `Other Download Options`.
3.	Look for the table under sub section `SDK Tools Only`.
4.	Click on the Package [installer_r24-windows.exe](http://dl.google.com/android/installer_r24-windows.exe) under Platform `Windows`.
5.	Accept the License Agreement.
6.	Click on the button `Download installer_r24-windows.exe`.
7.	Double-click the downloaded executable to start the installation.
8.	Make a note of the name and location where you save the Android SDK on your system, as you will need to refer to the standalone Android SDK directory later when installing EMDK for Android.


### Configuring the Android Developer Tools (ADT) for EMDK
The EMDK requires Android API's 16 and 19 to be Installed.

To check which API's you have installed:

1. In Eclipse go to `Window` then `Android SDK Manager`
2. Check that the status of `Android 1.1.2 (API 16)` and `Android  4.4.2 (API 19)` SDK Platforms status is `Installed`.
3. If either SDK platform is not installed check the SDK check mark, click `Install Packages`, and follow the on screen instructions. When the install is complete restart Eclipse.

##Manually Remove EMDK for Android
In most cases running the uninstall program will cleanly remove EMDK For Android from your PC. If the uninstall fails for whatever reason, you may not be able to reinstall. The following directions will allow you to cleanly uninstall all components of the EMDK For Android. Follow the step by step instructions below:

###1. Removing installed EMDK directory
1. Open command prompt, type `regedt32` and press Enter.
2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key:
* On 32-Bit OS `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall]`
* On 64-Bit OS `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion \Uninstall]`

3. Each key listed under Uninstall in the left pane of Registry Editor represents a program that is currently installed. Scroll through and identify the registry key that has the name EMDK for Android (See Fig.01 or Fig.02).
* Fig.01

* Fig.02
	![img](images/setup/uninstallfig2.png)

4. Under key EMDK for Android look for the value UninstallString in the details pane on the right and identify the EMDK for Android installation path (i.e. the parent directory where uninstall.exe resides. See Fig.01 or Fig.02).

5. Locate and delete the Symbol EMDK for Android folder, subfolders and files.

###2. Removing installed EMDK samples directory

1. Locate and delete the Symbol EMDK for Android folder available at `Users\Public`.

###3. Removing installed EMDK short cuts under Start Programs

1. Locate and delete the following folder available at `<Profile folder>All Users\Start Menu\Programs`:
* `Symbol EMDK for Android vX.X` where vX.X = Base version of the Installation.
	* Example: `v3.0` when you have installed `EMDK for Android v3.0`

	* Example: `v3.0` when you have installed `EMDK for Android v3.0`

###4. Removing installed EMDK plug-in and add-on from ADT/ Eclipse IDE and Android SDK

>Note: Make sure to close all the Android Developer Tools (ADT)/ Eclipse IDE windows before proceeding.

1. For ADT Bundle users, under key EMDK for Android look for the value ADTRootFolder in the details pane on the right and identify the ADT Bundle root folder (see Fig.01).
2. Locate and remove the Eclipse plug-in and SDK add-on installed by EMDK as below:
