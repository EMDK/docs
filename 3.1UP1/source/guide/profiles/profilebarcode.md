# Barcode Profile Feature Reference

## Overview
In order to get Barcode data in your application, you must create a profile with two profile features selected:

* Barcode
* [Keystroke](../guide/profiles/profilekeystroke),[Intent](../guide/profiles/profileintent),[IP](../guide/profiles/profileIP) (Output)

The `Barcode` feature in the Profile Manager is responsible for reading data from the device's integrated bar code scanner and supports different types of bar code readers including laser, imager and internal camera. It also contains detailed parameters for scanner behavior as well as individual barcode symbology parameters.

The `Intent`, `Keystroke` or `IP` feature in the Profile Manager is used to define how the output from the Barcode scanner should be handled

* Intent - The Intent feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application using the Android Intent mechanism. To use this, you should be familiar with how to register to receive intents in your application as well as handling the data that is passed in. You will have the ability to configure how the intent is sent to your application in the profile itself.

* Keystroke - The Keystroke feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application by emulating keystrokes. You will have the option to control how the data is sent as well as if it should have any prefix or suffix automatically added using basic data formatting.

* IP - IP Output allows DataWedge to send captured data to a host computer via a network connection. Captured data can be sent over an IP network to a specified IP address and port using either TCP or UDP transport protocols.

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.

## Enabled
Enables or disables this feature. Default is enabled.

## Scanner Selection

	* Concat Mode Always - There must be two ISBT codes in order to decode and perform concatenation. Does not decode single ISBT symbols.
	* Concat Mode Auto - Decodes and concatenates pairs of ISBT codes immediately. If only a single ISBT symbol is present, the device must decode the symbol the number of times set via Redundancy - Code128 before transmitting its data to confirm that there is no additional ISBT symbol.
* Check ISBT Table - The ISBT specification includes a table that lists several types of ISBT bar codes that are commonly used in pairs. If ISBT128 Concat Mode is set, enable Check ISBT Table to concatenate only those pairs found in this table. Other types of ISBT codes are not concatenated.
* Security Level - The scanner offers four levels of decode security for Code 128 bar codes. Select increasing levels of security for decreasing levels of bar code quality. There is an inverse relationship between security and scanner aggressiveness, so choose only that level of security necessary for any given application.
	* Security Level 0 - This setting allows the scanner to operate in its most aggressive state, while providing sufficient security in decoding most "in-spec" bar codes.
	* Security Level 1 - This setting eliminates most misdecodes.
	* Security Level 2 - Select this option if Security level 1 fails to eliminate misdecodes.
	* Security Level 3 - If Security Level 2 is selected and misdecodes still occur, select this security level. Be advised, selecting this option is an extreme measure against mis-decoding severely out of spec bar codes. Selecting this level of security significantly impairs the decoding ability of the scanner. If this level of security is needed, try to improve the quality of the bar codes.

	* Level 0 - This default setting allows the scanner to operate fastest, while providing sufficient security in decoding "in-spec" UPC/EAN bar codes.
	* Level 1 - As bar code quality levels diminish, certain characters become prone to misdecodes before others (i.e., 1, 2, 7, 8). If the scanner is misdecoding poorly printed bar codes, and the misdecodes are limited to these characters, select this security level.
	* Level 2 - If the scanner is misdecoding poorly printed bar codes, and the misdecodes are not limited to characters 1, 2, 7, and 8, select this security level.
	* Level 3 - If the scanner is still misdecoding, select this security level. Be advised, selecting this option is an extreme measure against misdecoding severely out of spec bar codes. Selecting this level of security can significantly impair the decoding ability of the scanner. If this level of security is necessary, try to improve the quality of the bar codes.
* Supplemental2 - Enables or disables this option.
* Supplemental5 - Enables or disables this option.
* Supplemental Mode
	* No Supplementals - the scanner is presented with a UPC/EAN plus supplemental symbol, the
	scanner decodes UPC/EAN and ignores the supplemental characters.
	* Supplemental Always - the scanner only decodes UPC/EAN symbols with supplemental characters, and ignores symbols without supplementals.
	* Supplements Auto - the scanner decodes UPC/EAN symbols with supplemental characters immediately. If the symbol does not have a supplemental, the scanner must decode the bar code the number of times set via UPC/EAN Supplemental Redundancy before transmitting its data to confirm that there is no supplemental.
	* Supplemental Smart - Enables smart supplementals. In this mode the decoder returns the decoded value of the main block right away if it does not belong to one of the following supplemental types: 378, 379, 977, 978, 979, 414, 419, 434 or 439. If the bar code starts with one of the prefixes it searches the image more aggressively for a supplemental. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.
	* Supplemental 378-379 - Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 378 or 379. Disables reading of supplementals for any other UPC/EAN bar code not starting with 378 or 379. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.
	* Supplemental 978-979 - Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 978 or 979. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN bar code not starting with 978 or 979. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.
	* Supplemental 414-419-434-439 - Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 414, 419, 434 or 439. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN bar code not starting with 414, 419, 434 or 439. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.
	* Supplemental 977 - Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 977. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN barcode not starting with 977. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.
* Retry Count - Retry count for auto-discriminating for supplementals. Possible values are 2 to 20 inclusive. Note that this flag is only considered if Supplemental Mode - UPC EAN is set to one of the following values: Supplementals Auto, Supplementals Smart, Supplementals 378-379, Supplementals 978-979, Supplementals 977 or Supplementals 414-419-434-439 (2 to 20).

* Volume Type
	* Ringer
	* Music and Media
	* Alarms
	* Notification
* Decode Audio Feedback - Select an audio tone to sound upon a good decode.
	* The audio tones stored as Application’s private data (i.e. cache, asset) should not be specified for this field to avoid access violation. Therefore any audio tones meant for this purpose must be stored under shared public directories (Music/ , Ringtones/) or shared “external storage”.
* Decode Haptic Feedback - Enable the MC40 to vibrate upon a good decode.
* BT Disconnect On Exit - Enable/Disable Bluetooth disconnect on exit.
