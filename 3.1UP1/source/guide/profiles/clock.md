# Clock Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview

Clock allows for a programmatic way to set the date and time. To account for time zone nuances including daylight saving time, Clock expects the values for date and time to be entered as normalized values to UTC (GMT) time. In other words, the date and time set as parameters for Clock must be the UTC (GMT) equivalent of the local time being set. 

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.

### Main Functionality

* Set the Time Zone
* Set the Date
* Set the Time
* Enable Auto Time
* Disable Auto Time
* Set NTP Server Address
* Set Sync Interval

## AutoTime
Use an NTP server to automatically set the time, date and timezone. The NTP server will be synced at the specified interval.

* NTP Server - the IP address of the NTP server
* SyncInterval - time will be automatically synced at this interval

## TimeZone 
Provide the TimeZone that the device should be set to. Note: The supported values for time zone are the same as Android supported values. For example, GMT-5 or Olson name such as America/New_York.

## Date 
Provide the Date the device will be set to when the profile is enabled. It must have a length of 10 and must be in the format 'yyyy-MM-dd' (for example : 2014-12-31). It must be specified in UTC (Universal Time Coordinates) and not in LTC (Local Time Coordinates).

## Time
Provide the Time the device will be set to when the profile is enabled. It must have a length of 8 and must be in the format HH:mm:ss (for example : 23:59:59). It must be specified in UTC (Universal Time Coordinates) and not in LTC (Local Time Coordinates).

## Usage Notes

###Example #1
We want to set the clock with the following settings:

* Set the date to 15-Jan-2010
* Set the time to 2:15PM local time
* Set the time zone to New York, New York, USA

15-Jan is eastern standard time in New York and not daylight saving time meaning it is GMT-04:00. So the parameters to use for Clock would be:

* TimeZone = New York, New York, USA
* Date = 15-Jan-2010 (2010-01-15)
* Time = 6:15PM (18:15:00)

###Example #2
We want to set the clock with the following settings:

* Set the date to 11-Jul-2014
* Set the time to 2:55AM local time
* Set the time zone to Bangalore, India

The time zone for Bangalore is GMT+05:30. So the parameters to use for Clock would be:

* TimeZone Bangalore, India
* Date = 10-Jul-2010 (2010-07-10)
* Time = 9:25PM (21:25:00)

Note the change of date as well as time. In this case, as the device converts this to local time, the date and time will both automatically be set properly when the offset is applied.
