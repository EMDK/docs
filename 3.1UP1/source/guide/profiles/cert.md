# Certificate Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview

The Cert Manager feature allows your application to install or uninstall certificates and initialize the Android key store. You can use digital certificates to identify your device for a variety of purposes, including VPN or Wi-Fi network access as well as authentication to servers by apps such as Email or Chrome. 

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.

## Main Functionality

* Install Certificate
* Uninstall Certificate
* Initialize Android Keystore
* Adjust System Clock

## Initialize Android Keystore
When you initialize the Android keystore you create a new keystore replacing any previously existing one.  Before installing or uninstalling certificates, a keystore must exist. You can choose to perform this action as a separate EMDK profile or include the Certificate Manager feature multiple times in one profile.

### Keystore Password
Keystore Password is a password required to initialize the Android Keystore.

## Install Certificate

### Certificate Alias

* Provide the name(alias) that will uniquely identify the certificate. The old certificate with same alias name will be replaced by the new certificate.
* Dynamic - The name of the cert is dynamically generated (This is currently not supported)

#### Alias Handling Issues
Due to current limitations of the Certificate Manager Feature (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to "override" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore

The only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android KeyStore after installation to determine which Alias was used:

1. The same Alias will ALWAYS be assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed

2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias will generally be assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key

#### Manually Determining the Certificate Alias
A device can be used to capture the alias being used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that the key store be cleared before performing these steps (Settings/Security/Clear Credentials)

1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.
2. Navigate to Settings/Wi-Fi/'+'' to add a network
3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP
4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS
5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop down box with "(unspecified)" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.

###Certificate Type  
Type of certificate to be installed:

* CA Certificate (*.PEM)
* Client Certificate (*.PEM)
* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.PFX)
* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.P12)
* Client Certificate and Private Key (*.PKCS12)

>Note: Be sure to initialize the keystore the first time when installing certificate types with private keys (.PFX,.P12,.PKCS12)

### Certificate method
Reference certificate file - method used to install a certificate. A file must exists on the device that contains the certificate data.

### Certificate File
Specify the path and name of the to the certificate file that resides on the device.

### Private Key Password
Password required to decrypt the private key (*.PFX, *.P12, *.PKCS12).

## Uninstall Certificate

### Certificate Alias
Provide the name(alias) that will uniquely identify the certificate. The key store or trusted CA store will be searched for a record with the same alias name. If the record is found, it removes the key store or trusted CA store.
