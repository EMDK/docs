# Battery Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview
Zebra's Device batteries store information in their internal memory, for instance, the number of charge cycles a battery has accumulated.  Zebra's Android devices expose this through a battery settings menu that displays the accumulated information.  These Android devices are configured with a Decommission Threshold Value that is the maximum number of charge cycles a battery can accumulate before being flagged as a battery that should be replaced. Battery Manager allows the developer to modify that Decommission Threshold from its factory setting.


## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.
