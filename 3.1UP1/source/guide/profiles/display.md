# Display Manager Profile Feature Reference

## Overview

The Display Manager feature allows your application to control the screen timeout value to conserve power.

## Name
The name field is used by the EMDK to identify this particular feature parameter set when you want to manage just part of the profile programmatically using the EMDK [ProfileManager](../api/ProfileManager) API. This can be useful if you have multiple types of the same feature and want to update only one of them without having to update the whole profile. See [EMDK Profiles Overview](../guide/profiles/usingwizard) for more information.

## Main Functionality
* Set the Screen Timeout Interval


##Screen Timeout Interval
